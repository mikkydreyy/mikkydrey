<p>Davido was born on November 21, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, to a wealthy Nigerian family. His father, Adedeji Adeleke, is a business magnate and founder of Adeleke University, and his late mother, Veronica Adeleke, was a university lecturer. Growing up in a privileged environment, Davido was exposed to music from a young age, developing an early passion for the art.</p>

<p>Davido attended the British International School in Lagos, Nigeria, before moving back to the United States to study business administration at Oakwood University in Alabama. However, his passion for music led him to drop out and pursue a career in music full-time. Despite initial resistance from his family, Davido's talent and determination saw him persist, and he later earned a degree in music from Babcock University, Nigeria, in 2015, a program specifically created for him by the institution.</p>
